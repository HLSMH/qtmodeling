- Check wheather RW multi-values properties are erroneously shown as RO in property editor
- Fix XMI writing of models using imported elements/packages and/or applied profiles
- Verify why QList<QObject *> cannot be directly passed to QML. Only QVariantList works by now
- Investigate the use of qScriptRegisterSequenceMetaType also for QSets (see src/plugins/metamodels/duse/qdusemetamodel.cpp)
- The property visibility, for attributes, when changing isn't presented in boldface in property editor
