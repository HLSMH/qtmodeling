    \brief A signal is a specification of send request instances communicated between objects. The receiving object handles the received request instances as specified by its receptions. The data carried by a send request (which was passed to it by the send invocation occurrence that caused that request) are represented as attributes of the signal. A signal is defined independently of the classifiers handling the signal occurrence.
